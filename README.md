## API

### POST

Send a post request to the [Heroku](https://url-shortly.herokuapp.com/urls) endpoint passing in your long url as `?url=LONG-URL-HERE`.

Example with Postman:

The return value then looks like:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "original": "https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html",
    "shortened": "I1dWHY",
    "title": "Getting Started with Rails â€” Ruby on Rails Guides",
    "clicks": 0,
    "created_at": "2018-12-03T03:20:23.938-05:00",
    "updated_at": "2018-12-03T03:20:23.938-05:00"
}
```

The response holds the database ID number, the original url, the shortened url hash, the title of the url document, the number of clicks or number of times the shortened form has been used, and finally the timestamps.

### GET

Send a get request to the [Heroku](https://url-shortly.herokuapp.com/) endpoint passing the shortened url to be redirected to the original url.

Example with Postman:
![Postman Example - GET](https://i.imgur.com/1tWFj9m.png)

Here we used the shortend hash value `DQVHRM` and were redirected to the original link "https://tour.golang.org/basics/6". This is the custom URL generator in action!

### List by most popular

The root route to `urls#index` returns a json response of all the urls, listed in order from most popular to least popular. The popularity is determined by the number of clicks the shortened version of the URL has. *Note: some urls were entered into the database before the implementation of the "fetch title" background job and as such do not have titles.*
